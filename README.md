## What is esProc?

The professional data computing engine for structured data computing.

- __Beyond the computing power of the database__


    esProc does not rely on the computing power of the database, and has an independent computing engine.

- __Open computing system__

    Universal computing can be implemented for any data source.

- __Agile syntax__

    Full combination of discreteness and set-orientation.

    Supper ordered calculation.

    Good at complex operations.

    High performance basic algorithms and storage mechanisms.



## What is SPL?

<b>S</b>tructured <b>P</b>rocess <b>L</b>anguage — <b>SPL</b> is the programming language used by esProc.

- __Combined the common advantages of SQL and Java__

  Adapt to set batch computation (SQL advantage)
  
  Good at step-by-step procedure computing (Java advantage)

- __Well designed rich library functions and consistency syntax__

  Easier to master and better performance than Python
  
- __Seamless integration into Java applications__

## SPL application scenarios

- __Got SQL__

    __SQL has certain computing power, but it is not available in many scenarios, so you will have to hard code in Java. 
    SPL provides lightweight computing power independent of database and can process data in any scenario:__
    
    - Structured text (txt/csv) calculation
    
    - Excel calculation
    
    - Perform SQL on files
    
    - Multi-layer json calculation
    
    - Multi-layer xml calculation
    
    - Java computing class library, surpass Stream/Kotlin/Scala
    
    - Replace ORM to implement business logic
    
    - SQL-like calculation on Mongodb, association calculation
    
    - Post calculation of WebService/Restful
    
    - Post calculation of Salesforce, Post calculation of SAP
    
    - Post calculation of various data sources: HBase,Cassandra,Redis,ElasticSearch,Kafka,…

- __Beyond SQL__

    __SQL is difficult to deal with complex sets and ordered operations, and it is often read out and calculated in Java.
    SPL has complete set capability, especially supports ordered and step-by-step calculation, which can simplify these operations:__

    - Ordered set

    - Position reference
    
    - Grouping subsets
    
    - Non-equivalence grouping
    
    - Multi-level association operation
    
    - Static and dynamic pivot
    
    - Recursion and iteration
    
    - Step-by-step and loop operation
    
    - Text and date time operation

- __Cooperate DB__

    __The computing power of the database is closed and cannot process data outside the database. It is often necessary to perform ETL to import data into the same       database before processing.__
    
    __SPL provides open and simple computing power, which can directly read multiple databases, realize mixed data calculation, and assist the database to do           better calculation.__

    - Fetch data in parallel to accelerate JDBC
    
    - SQL migration among different types of databases
    
    - Cross database operations
    
    - T+0 statistics and query
    
    - Replace stored procedure operation, improve code portability and reduce coupling
    
    - Avoid making ETL into ELT or even LET
    
    - Mixed calculation of multiple data sources
    
    - Reduce intermediate tables in the database
    
    - Report data source development, support hot switching, multiple data sources and improve development efficiency
    
    - Implement microservices, occupy less resources and support hot switching



- __Surpass DB__

- __For Excel__

- __For Industry__
